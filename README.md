# Django_with_ReactJS
This is my repository in learning Django with React JS as a basis for our project in software engineering in for future references

## Django and python versions 
- **Python**- 3.12.1
- **Django**- 5.0

## How to run the application
- cd to a folder
- run: [app_name]ENV/Scripts/activate 
- A virtual environment should run 
- cd to the app 
- run: manage.py runserver 

### TODO app requirements 
- pip install djangorestframework 
- pip install markdown 
- pip install django-filter
#### Why do we need to run virutal environments 
- It is recommended to use a virtual environment when working with Django or Python because it helps to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts with system-level Python installations.
